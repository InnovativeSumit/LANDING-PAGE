# 🌐 Amazing Landing Page - Oasis Infobyte Task


## ✨ Project Overview

Welcome to my **Landing Page Project** built purely using **HTML** and **CSS** – no frameworks, no JavaScript!  
This was developed as part of a **Web Development Internship Task by [Oasis Infobyte](https://oasisinfobyte.com/)**.

This project demonstrates a modern, responsive, and visually appealing landing page designed from scratch.  
The main goal was to apply core front-end skills to create a fully functional layout that mimics a professional landing experience.
